# Machine Learning exam

This is a computational project I wrote for the Machine learning exam. I used a biological dataset I found on Kaggle.com.
It contains information regarding the physical and origin characteristics of three different species of Antarctic penguins üêß.

Indeed, the purpose of my work was to classify penguin species based on the most relevant characteristics. After selecting the most important features and choosing the type of classifier, I evaluated the accuracy of the model and constructed a decision boundary based on the reduced features.
